Kathy,

Just had another moment to say hello.  How are you and how are things?  Still busy here - and I haven't even seen Robin - I think she has given up on me!!  In fact, I think I will call her when I finish this email.  At least I know I will see her in a couple of weeks when Chris and Katie come to houston.  Wish you could come with them - that would be fun!

Still working on the man situation - it was a topic of coversation amongst my friends last night.  I will keep you posted!

Hope all is well and keep in touch!!

Love, Kim
