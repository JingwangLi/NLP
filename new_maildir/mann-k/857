Hi there!

Sounds like things are going really well.

Neil is working tomorrow (his turn), then we have a wedding to go to Saturday 
night. Paige isn't coming in until Sunday, leaving Tuesday or Wednesday.  
She's visiting friends in Waco.  You know how it goes with juniors. So, it 
doesn't look good for us to  make it to Palacios this weekend.  How long are 
you going to be there?

Gotta get on the phone.

Love,

Kay
