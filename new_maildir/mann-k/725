I don't know numerical addresses, just cross streets.  This week I stayed at 
52nd and Madison, time before I stayed at either 72 or 77th and Madison. 
Madison is close to 5th.  I'm going to guess that he is living above 50th, as 
I had the impression that he was living in a pretty swanky area.

The weather is beautiful here.  Hope it lasts a couple of days.

Neil loves his pig.  I don't think he has picked a place for it yet, though.

Have a great day!

Love,

Kay
