Thanks for hanging in there and getting it done.  

How come you didn't tell me that you didn't get Ben's initials?  I never 
expect to have to follow up with you to see if you did what we discussed.  I 
just always assume that you've taken care of it, unless you tell me 
otherwise.  I don't want to change my expectations.  Deal?
