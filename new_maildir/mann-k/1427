I don't feel as bad as I did when I woke up.  My face hurt so badly.  Neil 
was so sweet bringing me hot washcloths.  It really helped. I'm running a low 
grade fever, and I know it is a sinus infection.  I took a really hot shower 
around 5 this morning, but it didn't help much.  Advil helped!  I spent a lot 
of time outside yesterday, and I'm paying for it.
