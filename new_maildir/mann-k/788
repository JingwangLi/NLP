Michael is still running 102 fever.  I spoke to the doctor again today, and 
he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep.  I'm feeling better, 
though, and have gotten a decent amount of work done.  In fact, Christy 
Chapman may give you some original documents I initialled and faxed to her.  
I'll explain later.  If I had your fax number I think I would have faxed them 
to you.

Have a great day tomorrow.

Kay
