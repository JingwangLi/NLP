I figured you knew, but I thought I'd better be certain.  I'm wondering about 
Bart, too.  Bob said he (Bob) is getting a nice raise, and I heard he got a 
signing bonus.  Oh, I heard it from Dan,, so you probably know.   

Are they looking for someone to replace Pat?  I like Glenn, the temp on 31 
who was working for Ben.  I don't know his skills, but he is great on the 
phone.
