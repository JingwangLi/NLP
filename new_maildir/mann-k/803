Poor Carlos.  He is almost pitiful.  I think it is a great idea to watch for 
a good networking opportunity.

I'm off on Friday, too.  In fact, both Michael and I have strep throat and 
spent the day at home.  I'll probably be in no more than 1/2 day tomorrow.  
Is Norman still out of town?  Will you have the house ALL to yourself?
