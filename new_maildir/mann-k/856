Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays?  I think on most 
Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon, but beyond that I really don't know.  I 
don't know if Paige will be here still, but she might.  Buy you really don't 
need to do that, as we don't mind getting it whenever we next come to 
Palacios -  makes the fun last longer.  We won't even celebrate our 
anniversary until the weekend, as I will be out of town Tuesday-Wednesday 
(New York), and Neil is gone Thursday-Friday (Dallas).  Tag team parenting!  

Love,

Kay
