I am so sorry to hear about Annie.  Did it break in a different place? I 
think they sometimes have to wait for the swelling to go down to really tell 
what is happening.

Michael had a good time. Thanks for having him.  He was SOOO excited when 
Paige got home yesterday.  He is just crazy for her.

Thanks for the bird house.  We are going to put it in the kitchen on top of 
the cabinets.

All is fine here.  Just buzy as usual!

Love,

Kay
