Hi,

Things are going just fine here.  I'm looking forward to spring - baseball 
and gardening.  I want more weather like last weekend.

I was in NYC last week.  I managed to get lost walking around Midtown.  I 
know, that's impossible.  I was talking on my cell and walking.  I walked 
from Bloomingdale's to somewhere east and slightly north of the theater 
district.  Oh, I should add I was headed to the Omni at 52nd and Madison.  
When I realized I was walking downhill with only warehouses ahead, it clicked 
that I was off track.  My feet hurt so badly when I got back I could hardly 
stand it.

Are you going to spring training this year? 

Gotta get back to work. Thanks for writing.

Kay
