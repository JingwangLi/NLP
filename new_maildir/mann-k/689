You are right on all points (especially the punting one!).  You should have 
the list of specific "fill in the blank" stuff which I forwarded recently.  
Also, we had a discussion yesterday with GE on the form of the 
assignment/assumption agreement, so there shouldn't be anything required of 
you from that standpoint.  

I'm here today (wasn't yesterday) and will be happy to discuss it with you.
