Hi Gregg,

I've sent John an email (didn't have his number).  If you have it I will 
follow up  with a phone call.

I was out yesterday (jury duty called) and Janet was out-of-pocket this 
afternoon.  I'll try to track her down tomorrow.

I will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax, and will 
send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop.

Kay
