Hi there. This came in while I was on the road.

Mac mentioned his girlfriend, but he didn't mention the Rice thing.  Hmmm.  
We would love to have him at UH, since he won't aim any higher, and we thing 
it beats SWTS.  He and his friend were wonderful house guests.  

I hope no one got worse on your b day.  Many happy returns!

Love,

Kay
