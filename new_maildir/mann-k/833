I'm thinking you don't have anything to move.  Maybe it would help if you 
acknowledged that ENA might not be your final destination, but seems like a 
good place to get exposed to a variety of opportunites, such as Enron Global 
Markets and Enron Industrial Markets - both new businesses with international 
aspects. Plus, lawyers at ENA move between groups without much fuss and 
bother (if it changes, don't blame me later!)

How does that sound?
