Where do you want this to go?

Someone (I think Dave) asked that this be added:

Each day EPMI shall provide EPMI's Native Load projection, and gas and power 
projection.

Would it be a projection of  MDEA's Native Load?  Are we providing it or is 
MDEA?  By what time is the  made  and is it made 365 days a year?
