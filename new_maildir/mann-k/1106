Hi Lupe,

I heard a rumor that Tribasa had found somebody to buy out the loan.  Another 
victim, perhaps?

I can't imagine how you must have felt to get a call from Don.  Maybe he's 
looking for a new opportunity in Mexico, since Bufete didn't pan out.

I've been busy working on a read deal with some very bright commercial 
people.  It is very challenging.  Sometimes I feel so uninformed.  This is a 
nice change! I feel like it is elevating my professional development.

I ran into Chip recently.  He seems happier now that he has Erik's old job.

More hugs - 

Kay
