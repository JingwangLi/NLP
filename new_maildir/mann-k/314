I'm in NYC, returning tomorrow.  Neil hasn't mentioned Mac calling, but I 
really didn't think we would hear from him again before today.

We meant to leave the stereo - hope you don't mind.  Paige got a new one for 
Christmas, and her old one seemed perfect for the Pink House.  

We enjoyed our visit also.  Thanks for everything.

Sorry to hear about the girls.  Tis the season.  I hope Lisa has a nice 
birthday tomorrow, even with sick kids.

Gotta go meet someone.

Love,

Kay
