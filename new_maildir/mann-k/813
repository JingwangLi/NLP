How's Annie doing?  Has she seen her regular (sigh) orthopod yet? 

Do the girls (and I guess you grown ups can probably go, too) want to go to 
SU? Are the young ladies interested in spending the night?  

I'm home with Michael (the 102 fever drill), working at home.

Hi to all!

Love,

Kay

PS  Thanks for the traffic tip.  Do the games last about 4 hours?  I can't 
remember.
