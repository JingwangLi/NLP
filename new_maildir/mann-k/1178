Mom was asking my about cake, and I don't know what is on the menu for 
dessert.  Guess we can ask for cake.  Neil thought we should have cake at the 
PH.  Guess that makes sense, too.

You want to coordinate on when to get there? That may be too out of character 
for all of us, but we can aspire to organization.

It is hot here, too.  The wind in the afternoon is really oppressive.  Dry 
heat - HA!  It is still darn hot.

I cringe at the thought of Six Flags.  I'm sure Paige can be bought.  She 
went recently and had a big time.

Hope your week is quiet.

Love/hugs, etc, to all,

Kay
