Hi.  Happy Mother's Day.

I was kinda hoping for a post-graduation family  event on that Saturday, as 
hopes were raised when the ticket issue came up.  Doesn't sound like that's 
happening.   I don't know when we will be up that way, but it wouldn't 
surprise me if we headed up Sat am.  That's Memorial Day weekend, so traffic 
out of Houston on Friday will be horrific.  Neil and I haven't discussed any 
details yet, though.

Paige is supposed to intern with the Houston Aeros this summer.  No pay, 
which is a bad thing.  She is currently on the way to Colorado with some 
friends, and will be back a week from Sunday.  I haven't even mentioned Mac's 
graduation yet.  

I just finished a really busy time, and I'm optimistic that things will 
resume a more normal pace.  I hope to catch up on yard work this weekend, 
maybe clean out a closet.  I have the urge to purge.  

I would say the Katie got the Clarke math gene, but Paige is a math whiz.  It 
must be a recessive characteristic.  It is great that the girls have 
different arenas in which to excel.  

I sent Mom a table top cactus garden.  Hope it gets there.  

No clue on what to get Mac.  I guess I should ask Paige for ideas.  If I get 
some good ones from her or Mikey I'll let you know.

Love,

Kay
