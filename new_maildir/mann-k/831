Ok.  I'll follow up.

The insanity continues.  I finally called Lee Johnson at S&S, who fortunately 
had called me, and asked him if he knew if Kent was around, as I hadn't heard 
from him.  He is going to get in touch with Kent for me.

I'm expediting Paul Pipitone re the ABB facility agreement, but haven't heard 
back from him yet.

Hope your trip is going well.
