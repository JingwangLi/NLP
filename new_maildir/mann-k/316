Hi Gerry,

I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember 
seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if 
payment isn't due yet.  I always thought that was strange, and sure created 
clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does 
Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave 
many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed the laws, 
though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've remembered.

If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday 
at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21. Very 
disruptive of my self-perception.

Ciao,

Kay
