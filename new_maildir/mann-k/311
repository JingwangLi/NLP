I  checked all my emails, and I don't have any indication that I 
received/reviewed this version of the document.  The redline is the redline 
against the last version I have on file.  If the other folks sign before it 
has been reviewed internally, it is possible that changes will be required.  
It won't be extensive.

I will ask Karen Way to call me before making changes to drafts, or at least 
advising me via email so that things will flow more smoothly.
