Hi Clark,

Good to hear from you.  I'm headed to NYC this week, so lunch doesn't look 
good.  I would love to see Nancy, though.  She did a very nice job for us.

I can't find any information on Corey.  Can you give me a little background 
information?  I couldn't find him in the BP directory or website.

Hope all is well with you, and I hope we can get together soon.

Kay
