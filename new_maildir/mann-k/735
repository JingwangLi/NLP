I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend.  I'm glad it worked out 
ok.  I tried calling last night but got a busy signal. 

When Michael's school asked for names/addresses of grandparents, I didn't 
know they were going to send a request for $.  Sorry about that!

We are trying to figure out Paige's plans for Thanksgiving, although I'm 
about to give up on figuring it out. She doesn't know if she can get a ticket 
to the game yet. I'm kinda in the mood to cook, but that's as far as we've 
gotten.  Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday?  We'll 
probably figure things out in the next few days.

We are waiting to see if I'm going to be in town on Thursday to make plans.  
I haven't been out of town since our anniversary, so it must be time to go 
again!  Generally speaking Neil gets home around 600.

Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today.  I can sure see along way 
today.

Love,

Kay
