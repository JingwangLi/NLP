Hey Andrea,

We are going to FW tomorrow, as my dad is having surgery to unclog one of his 
carotid arteries.  I'm kinda nervous about this one.  Everything else is 
going well.  Michael, Paige and Neil are all well and happy.  Paige has 
applied to the Astros for a summer job.  Seems like a long shot, but she 
really wants to do it.  Michael has a kid in his class named Colin Waters.  
His dad is the travel secretary for the Astros.  Unfortunately, I haven't met 
him yet.

I can't wait to hear about your reunion.  I know it will be a blast.  Have 
fun!

Kay
