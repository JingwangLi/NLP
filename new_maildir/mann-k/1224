I'm glad you found something interesting to do. Let me know if you meet 
anybody famous!

We now have televisions in the elevators.  At first, CNN ran all the time.  
This morning we started getting messages from management about the SAP 
program.  It is kind of odd to get into an empty elevator, but hear voices.  

I was discussing Enron with my 20 year old daughter.  I found it difficult to 
summarize what Enron does, and what kind of opportunities it has for college 
grads.  Any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated.

I know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back.  His gain is our 
loss, but I understand completely.

Take care and keep in touch,

Kay
