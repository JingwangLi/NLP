Tough question.  What happens if they don't pay their legal bills?  Won't 
they have difficulty closing?  We can pay their consulting fee up front. 
Maybe we can pay it into an escrow account.   

What is our concern?  They don't have to use lawyers if they don't want to, 
and Shutts doesn't have to work for them if they are uncomfortable.  
Obviously, Shutts has the ability to quote an upfront retainer.  I'm sure 
they've thought of that all ready.

I guess I'm not clear on our level of involvement with their lawyers.

I believe my availability is good for Wednesday.
