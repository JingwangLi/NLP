I agree it is Matt, and  I believe he has reviewed this tax stuff (or at 
least other turbine K's) before.  His concern will be us getting some amount 
of advance notice before title transfer (ie, delivery).  Obviously, he might 
have some other comments as well.  I'm happy to send him the latest, or maybe 
he can access the site?
