Dale,

Thanks for the update. I fully concur with all the rankings.
It seems things are going well with the Research Group in
London and this is, to a very large extent, your contribution.

I think that Anjam has improved a lot. I don't think, however,
that he can run the group in the future. Steve emerged as a natural
leader and has overwhelming support in the organization.
