Steve,

Thanks. I printed the fundamental info
last night and will wait for the open.

I negotiated a few contracts for  Enron's contribution to a book
(Enron was a sponsor).  It's not the same as negotiating as an author.

You can call a friend of mine, John Martin, and he will be able to help you.

Vince
