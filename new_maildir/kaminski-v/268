Dale,

My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London.
We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate 
this process.
Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around 
him
any longer.

I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase.
I would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility.
A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.
 We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in 
practically every location
where we operate.

A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false 
security for
both an employee and the company.

I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc 
you.
I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.

Vince
