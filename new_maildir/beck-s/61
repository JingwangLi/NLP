I will take a look at my calendar and let you know when I can come north.  I 
am heading to the airport in 5 minutes for a flight to Austin to make a 
presentation at UT tonight, capping off about four weeks with a lot of travel 
for me.  I will catch my breath on the plan and look at my schedule for the 
next few weeks and I will let you know.  

I sat by Sheila Knudsen at the ENA staff meeting on Friday afternoon last 
week, and asked her if we should now schedule VP reviews.  The VP PRC meeting 
(much rescheduled) did take place on September 11 and 12.  Sheila said that 
as of Friday (the 15th) that HR had not received the final results from the 
PRC, and that we should wait on reviews until we had that in hand.  I will 
check with HR this week so see if all is finalized, so that we can schedule 
the review.  I will keep you posted.
