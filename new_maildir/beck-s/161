He has been focused on Sitara for a long time.  He reports to Scott Mills, 
who is the user lead for the project.  I am copying Scott on this message, as 
his Sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the 
horizon and how critical Tom's involvement is to those deliverables.  I 
suggest that we involve Scott in these discussions.  --Sally
