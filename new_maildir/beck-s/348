Thanks for the responses -- all look great.  I like coming over knowing that 
my calendar will be pretty full.  Dinner sounds great, too.  I am having 
dinner with Beth Apollo on Monday evening to talk more about her assignment.  
I received a note from Fernley asking about dinner on Thursday evening also.  

Hope that the New York trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was 
smooth.  --Sally
