Thanks for the weather report.  I bought a good coat a couple of months ago 
with London and Calgary in mind.  Worked well in London two weeks ago, so I 
will come equipped with coat, gloves, scarf, etc.  

I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night.  If it would be good for 
you to get home at a reasonable hour, then we can all three have an early 
supper.  (If I get in bed early my body would probably be in shock, but would 
adjust!)  Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds 
great.  Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by 
alcohol.  I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and 
outside work - either way will work well for me.    --Sally
