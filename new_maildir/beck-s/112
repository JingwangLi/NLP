Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she 
will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep 
will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both 
wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you 
can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a 
way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new 
role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally
