Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset to 
our expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely 
case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs.  
With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.  

My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall 
summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had 
recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the 
projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite 
effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared 
to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, 
fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my 
direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a 
necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, 
etc.  If my reaction had been to say "what a talented group - we have to 
figure out how to best utilize them", then the outcome might have been 
different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two 
hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs 
for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious 
make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally
