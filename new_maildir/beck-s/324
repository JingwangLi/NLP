Thanks for your note on the promotion.  This was definitely a goal and is 
very rewarding to get there.  

I would love to talk with you about your second rotation.  In fact, I 
mentioned you to Jesus Melendrez just last week.  He works with John Thompson 
and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).  I 
filled him in on the Energy Management degree and told him that I thought 
that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation.  

I am in the London office this week.  Call Patti and ask her to schedule  a 
time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk 
about rotations.   I will look forward to it. 

Definitely put January 31 on your calendar for a tour of Enron Field and 
dinner (someplace downtown with heat -- any suggestions?).  Patti is working 
on some of the details this week for us to host Ted Jacobs and about 14 of 
his students while they are in town for NAPE.  --Sally
