I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what 
that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to 
schedule a photographer.  I will be in the office next week, Wednesday 
through Friday.  Then I will be on vacation the week of July 10th.  Let me 
know when the photographer will come, so that I will know what to wear!  
Thanks, and have a great long weekend.  --Sally
