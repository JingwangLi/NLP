Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for 
risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for 
several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last 
August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  

I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have 
potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just
