Thanks for copying me on this.  It is interesting to see your thoughts.  I 
suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.  I 
told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.  However, I 
also told him about my two dark-side fears:  (1)  that IT resources reporting 
to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on 
projects that we need, and (2)  taken to the extreme, that this concept would 
disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to 
managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this 
special team for them to handle.  Part of the fun in operations is improving 
things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the 
chance to implement creative business solutions.
