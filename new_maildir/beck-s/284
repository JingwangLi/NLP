Thanks, Marc.  I would like to get together with you, Mary  Solmonson and 
James Scribner to begin work on the model for scoping high, low and expected 
cases around the commercialization opportunities for mid and back office 
services.  Mary has just returned today from a week's vacation.  I will work 
on schedules and call you later this afternoon to see if we can have a 
kick-off meeting.  --Sally
