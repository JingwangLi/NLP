It was good to see you last week, too.  That was a big group, and there were 
many people that I just passed in the halls!  I would love to participate, 
but I will be out of town on September 14.  Rick Causey is hosting an offsite 
meeting from Septemer 13-15 in San Antonio.  Thanks for thinking of me.
