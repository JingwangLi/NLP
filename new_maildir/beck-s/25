Great to hear from you.  I was thinking about you today.  I will look forward 
to your starting on the 29th.  Certainly if anything comes up with the move 
or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.  I will be glad to 
have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working 
together.  

I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus 
Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.  I do feel 
as if I have been the PRC queen recently.  Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on 
Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday 
of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the 
Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  

I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on 
December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys 
will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for 
full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those 
days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.  

Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday.  --Sally
