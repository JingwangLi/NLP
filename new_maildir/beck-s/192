Thanks for your homework on this.  We will definitely take a look at these 
two places next week while we are in London.  Let us know what we need to do 
to schedule this.  I look forward to meeting you.  One of your earlier 
messages suggested meeting on Monday morning.  Monday is great, but we would 
have to make that an afternoon meeting.  Brent and I will be on the flight 
that leaves Houston at 7:00 PM on Sunday evening, arriving at Gatwick around 
10:00 AM.  By the time we clear customs, take the train, check in to the 
hotel and shower, we will not be in the office before 12:30 or 1:00.  Do you 
have a time available to meet with us that afternoon?   Thanks.  --Sally
