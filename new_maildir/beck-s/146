That meeting was about my 13th of the day that began at 7:30, and that was 
day three of the week with that kind of scheduling.  I apologize if I seemed 
impatient in the meeting.  I know that you are working for the best interests 
of Energy Operations and  Enron.  By the end of the day I was probably 
looking for crisp, clear solutions to an issue that probably doesn't lend 
itself well to that.  

Why don't we set up a lunch so that you and I can have the opportunity to 
talk separate from immediate issues at hand?  I will have Patti get a date on 
the calendar.  --Sally
