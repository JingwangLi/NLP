Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.  I will be out on vacation on 
Monday.  Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I 
will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one 
of my daughters.  I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum 
meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.  I will get back in touch 
if the Tuesday lunch does open up.  Would Amita like to meet at another time 
during those days?  There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on 
Tuesday evening.  How does that work with Amita's schedule?  --Sally
