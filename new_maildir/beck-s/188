I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next 
week and I had asked her to arrange  a lunch with you and Brent, plus some 
time for just the two of us to get together.  

We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of 
the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).  That will include a look at Continental 
power, UK power, UK gas and global products.  Looks as if sometime in April 
will be the date for that, however, not next week.  --Sally
