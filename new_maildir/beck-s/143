We willl consider that a rain check.  Just let know in a cooler month when 
you will be around and I know that David will make his schedule work to 
play.  

Separately, I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in 
Calgary the last time.  If you have a few minutes amidst the SAP training 
while you are in Houston, I would love to visit face to face to hear from 
your perspective how your interactions with my Houston operations group are 
going and to see you have any suggestions on areas of improvement.  Just give 
me a call at x35926.  --Sally
