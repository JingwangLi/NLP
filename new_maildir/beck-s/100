David is doing well, too.  He is working contract, having quit Burlington 
Resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible.  
Yes, Tammy is still with us.  We marked our 10 year anniversary with her in 
March, except for that six month period when she was with her dad in 
Kentucky.  I truly am blessed.  --Sally
