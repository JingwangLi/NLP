Jennifer,
The market just traded higher in the West in general during the month of 
March compared to February.  That is why we see the shift in NGI-MALIN and 
NGI-PGE CG.  As for IF-CIG WIC, it was also the way the market traded.  Other 
Rocky Mountain points were similar.  Please call if you have any further 
questions.
