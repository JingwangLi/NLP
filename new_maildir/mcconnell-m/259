Jeannie,
Hello, I'm back this morning from overseas.  I am assuming that you got what 
you needed but in case you are still waiting on a response, I like the 
article.  If you still have time or want any additional comments.  I would 
simply add a couple of products to the list of Enron Global Markets.  The 
group is also responsible for Global Risk Management (insurance products), 
LNG trading, agriculture trading, and Interest rate trading.  I just don't 
want to leave any groups out of the article if possible.  Thanks and good 
luck and i certainly understand if I'm too late.
