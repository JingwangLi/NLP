David,

Thanks for the email.
On metals, I believe all of that will remain under John Sherriff and not our 
new group.  Paper will remain in NA as well.  Both will be re-examined at 
some point but not now.  I like Cindy as well, she sounds fine to me.  Who is 
better, Cindy or Hoyt?

Do you want me to co-ordinate with Cindy while you are on vacation?

Thanks,
Mike
