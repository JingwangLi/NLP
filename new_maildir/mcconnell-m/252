Joe,
Sorry for the big delay in all my responses.  I'm out on vacation Wed - Wed. 
and can't make the video call. Please don't hesitate to set up with 
Shankman.  In general he is very on board with a big effort in Asia and 
realizes my views on Asia and that we have issues in Singapore.  Japan will 
be a  real focus for Enron Global Markets.  He could use an update.
