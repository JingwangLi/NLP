Stuart,

Thanks for the email and raising this issue.  While reading it, I must admit 
I was very surprised.  I am not a big baseball fan and have been to only 2 
games this year and I hadn't noticed it.  I just called Cindy Olson and left 
her a voicemail with your concern.  I will not forward your email and I will 
respect your privacy request.  When I hear from her, I'll let you what she 
says.

Thanks,
Mike
