Mark,

Thanks for the email.  Yes it was a very difficult decision to leave our 
group.  I've really enjoyed working with you and your group;  I think we have 
a great group.   I know you that you are working on  this side of the 
business already and I will be giving you a call to get your input and 
direction.

Cheers,
Mike
