Apologies again, we do need to talk.  Asia is critical to our growth and we 
do need to talk.  My schedule is a mess but as i stated in last email, go 
ahead and call Jeff and discuss.  LNG is ours and thanks for the input.  We 
will be making big changes and growing without incumbency.  Mike Brown does 
work for us but I dont really know what he does and would like your input.
