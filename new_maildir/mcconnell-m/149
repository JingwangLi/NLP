Thanks for the email and kind words.  

I did recover over thanksgiving and it was nice but I am sick once again and 
cant' sleep.  I am catchin up on this emai at 2:15 wednesday night.  I will 
try and go back to bed after this email.  

Let me know how the contract goes, i don't see any issues.  I actually 
thought it got done and that is why i havent heard anything.

Sooners have looked ugly lately, Saturday will not be a good day for the 
Sooners.

Mike
