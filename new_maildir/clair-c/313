Suzanne:
I'm pretty flexible.  The only days that appear to be bad if its done during 
lunch would be Friday, June 2 and Friday, June 16th.  As for ideas, I have 
NOTHING right now, but i know that Julia has some used stuff that she is 
going to give me.  We are planning on buying the furniture before the end of 
May.  As for the rest, I really hope to have all of that bought before the 
middle of June just in case.
