That is fine. I will make all of the chnages and send it around.  Also, on 
Constellation, I left a voice mail for their attorney that we have approved 
the CSP language and that I need to see their Guaranty.  What cutoff date are 
you expecting to see?  The last draft that I saw said June 30, 2001.  Is that 
acceptable?
