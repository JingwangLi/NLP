Dan:
Thanks for the e-mail.  Things are going very well.  The hospital stay was a 
little long but once we both got home things got much better.  I miss the 
work routine but I'm really enjoying my time with both Charles and Arthur, 
and of course Bill.  I hope to be up and around in a week or so.  my recovery 
has been slow and steady but except for a lack of sleep, I feel great.  Hope 
to be running soon.  I'll be up for a visit in a few weeks.  Take care.
