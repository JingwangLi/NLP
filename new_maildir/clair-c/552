Suzanne:
Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% 
pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to 
ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it 
right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all 
small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning 
how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep 
some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on 
little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles 
sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to 
finish.

tell dan happy birthday and as for yours, i'll catch up as soon as i become 
more portable which should be soon.  as for flower pick-up, feel free to stop 
by after work whenever.  just call and let me know.  i've got 2 baskets that 
will probably only survive here another day or so so you are welcome to them 
and you can sneak a peek at charles at the same time.  

well i've got to go.  i'll talk/see you soon.

ps - if anyone has some astros tickets for this weekend let me know as bill 
and arthur may want to go.
