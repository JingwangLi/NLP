Suzanne:
Please mail me my paycheck when you get a chance.    I'm glad that you had a 
great vacation.  We are doing well.  I've joined some tennis leagues at the 
club that we belong to and they are alot of fun.  Feel free to stop by some 
time this weekend if you are in the neighborhood.  We will be around most of 
the weekend.  Charles is doing great and so are the rest of the family.  
thank God Bill is home with me.  He is a big help as is Arthur.  Hope to see 
you soon.
