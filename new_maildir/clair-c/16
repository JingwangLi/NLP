Elizabeth:
Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I 
think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still 
fairly hectic.  I'll call you soon.  How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've 
been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad.  
I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to 
maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets 
beat.  talk to you soon.
