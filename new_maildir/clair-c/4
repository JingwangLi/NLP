Sara:
We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue.  
You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was 
limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the 
advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up 
with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated 
memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke).

Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should 
be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about 
this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take 
care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.
