After reviewing the Pre-hearing conference statement, I feel that at this juncture all that may be needed is for TW to enter an appearance. I don't believe that we currently have a position as to "whether PG&E's proposed resolution of the issues raised by parties in their protests is agreeable" such that we could file a statement as the judge has requested. Therfore, unless someone can summarize the parties positions and their impact on TW I would suggest that we use Jeff Dasovich to file an appearance for us since that would be the least costly alternative. If anyone has other suggestions please let me know.
