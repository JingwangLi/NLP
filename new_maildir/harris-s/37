Hi Cindy. Just thought I would drop a quick note to see how things are going. Thanks for the cards you sent the kids and I. Jeanie came down on Saturday but went back Sunday to Dallas. Maybe if you all get a chance you can come down during Christmas or New Years. I think Jim and his kids may be here also. Hope all is going well and we look forward to seeing you soon. Take care.
	Love,
		Steve
