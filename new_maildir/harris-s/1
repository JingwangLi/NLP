Hi beautiful. I had a hard time yesterday because I missed you so much (in case you couldn't tell). The more we are together the more I love you and want to spend all my time with you. I can't wait to see you.

Stan's staff meeting was cancelled so I am just trying to catch up on things this morning.

Love you sweetie.
