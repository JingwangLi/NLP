Dana,

It is very nice to hear from you. You are in Dallas, right? How is your family?

Well ...  yes I am living in Houston again. I still work for Enron ... I just returned from a business trip to the Middle East and India ... it was interesting but too long.

Guess what ... I got married on March 17th. Guess to whom ... Renee Freyou from Port Neches. Can you believe it!!!
