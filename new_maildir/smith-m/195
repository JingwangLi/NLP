Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of 
the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at 
about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great 
story!  I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.  Give me a call if you 
want to chat sometime.
