Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?
