I am very happy for you.  It sounds as if everything in your life is going in 
the right direction.  I think you will enjoy working in the DC ofice and for 
Joe.  I am sure you will learn alt.  Also, thank you for remembering Jason 
and Jessica's 1 year birthday.  The designer T-shirts were great and they 
look really cute in them.  That was very thoughful of you to remember.  Good 
luck!
