My apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how t=
he Enron real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like=
 real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. =20

I call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical =
product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on r=
eal-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Fir=
m  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the par=
ty selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each h=
our.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I wo=
uld be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  =
I would be short at $28.

The mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transacti=
on.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow su=
ch that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions th=
at needed to be prescheduled.

As far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following langu=
age to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal=
 review).

"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delive=
ry on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day =
of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-t=
ime means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consisten=
t with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."

Take a look, give me a call.  Thanks.
