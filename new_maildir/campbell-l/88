Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in 
fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask 
is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix 
D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other 
compressor station locations and have been approved to use "stain tubes" or 
total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can 
send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help.  
If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below 
referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be 
possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we 
have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us?
