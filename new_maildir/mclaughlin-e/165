Shannon,

I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you 
will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to 
split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and 
options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it 
done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not 
heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice 
mail.

Thanks,

Errol
