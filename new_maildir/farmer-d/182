Tom, 

For the EOG piece, bring the nom down to 4400 through the 7th.  For the 8th 
forward, leave the nom as is.  When we get more information next week, we can 
adjust as necessary.

Yates - What did they produce in Jan and Feb?  Let me know that and we can 
decide if we want to adjust the nom. 

Vintage - Adjust our nom to tie with Vintage.
