Mike, 

You can come down anytime.  The mornings will be the best time to learn, but 
you can spend as much time as you want.  Since things are so crazy, I may not 
be able to answer all of your questions immediately, but can answer them 
later.  I will probably be on vacation next Mon and Fri.  You can start with 
me tomorrow or next Tuesday, it's up to you.  We usually start trading around 
8:30.  We usually start the day at 7:30 with the Gas Control and Weather 
meeting.
