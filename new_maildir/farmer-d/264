Mike, 

I don't know of any deals that were negotiated for this delivery.  So, why 
don't you check with Gas Control to see if they know why vol was delivered on 
that day.  I would think that they had to send someone out there to make it 
happen.  Additionally, you can check with Gary Lamphier or Lee Papyoti to see 
if they made a deal with the plant.
