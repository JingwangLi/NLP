I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, 
bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level 
than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  
Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different 
than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I 
think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very 
impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  

Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car 
thief.
