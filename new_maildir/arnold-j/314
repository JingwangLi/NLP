Would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is I can't operate 
stack manager.  I need the ability to force everybody out of the website so 
people don't try to click numbers that are old.  

On a similar topic, what's the status of the out of credit message?  Still a 
very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me.  

Do I need to follow up with Bradford about lowering sigma?

Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk.
