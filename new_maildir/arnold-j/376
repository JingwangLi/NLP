I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, 
Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an 
issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are 
okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.  
Thanks for your help,
John
