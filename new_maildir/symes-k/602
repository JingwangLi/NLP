wait - i thought you weren't going to go there on corporate e-mail. where did 
this sudden attack come from? that's low - especially considering i'm deathly 
ill but still slaving away at work to band-aid the mistakes you guys spend 
all day making. and you are sadly mistaken in the rumors you've heard - i've 
never endeavored upon anything with anyone. my birdcage, if i had one, would 
be lined with your e-mails.
