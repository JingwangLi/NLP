I think we ran into this problem before where the California schedulers, for 
whatever reason, didn't pull the .8 Riverside deal into their sheet, and 
therefore I didn't see it or add it to the EES sheet. Let me just check with 
Phil on this to make sure he didn't do it for a reason; then I can amend the 
sheet and re-send it. 

And on the Wed./Thurs. generation volumes - I can only assume that Phil spoke 
with Riverside at some point about the change to .55, but again I need to 
speak with him to verify this. He should be in the office soon, and I'll let 
you know as soon as I find out.

Thanks,
Kate
