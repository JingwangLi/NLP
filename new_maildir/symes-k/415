I'm checking with Chris Foster and Chris Mallory, who are apparently the ones 
initiating these trades. Both are out of the office right now, so it might be 
tomorrow before I can get back to you on this. But my guess is that if APX 
does not want to receive confirms on daily deals, then we don't need to send 
them. I'll let you know for sure as soon as I talk to the traders.

Thanks,
Kate
