I just talked to Chris about this. Apparently, the Reliant trader thought he 
was clicking an SP-15 trade, and called immediately afterward to ask Chris if 
it could be adjusted. It was more lucrative for Chris to do this deal at 
SP-15 than NP-15 anyway, so he agreed. I guess I'm unclear about the exact 
EOL guidelines in a situation like this, but please let me know if there's 
anyone you'd like me to talk to. Chris didn't have the trader's name offhand, 
but I could probably get him to research it a bit more. Just let me know what 
you need from us.

Thanks,
Kate
