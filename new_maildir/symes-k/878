Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. 
Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter 
and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been 
put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was 
fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the 
agreement, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
