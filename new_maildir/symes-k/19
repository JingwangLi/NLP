This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
