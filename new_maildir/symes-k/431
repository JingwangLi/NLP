We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in 
fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, 
and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our 
deal correction report, but I thought I'd give you a heads up.

Thanks,
Kate
