You're right - Mike Driscoll entered this incorrectly, so I killed deal 
563929 and simply added three new legs to the existing deal they were trying 
to extend. Deal number 476578 now has legs 4, 5, and 6 to extend the deal 
under the same terms through April. Please let me know if this doesn't show 
up correctly for some reason.

Thanks,
Kate
