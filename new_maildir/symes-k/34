I've forwarded this e-mail to Christian and Greg. Unfortunately, the 
population of the office is quickly dwindling as the holidays come near. I've 
been told that one or the other of them will be in today, and I'll find out 
if something has been sent out already, and if not, how soon we can do that. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I talk to them.

Thanks,
Kate
