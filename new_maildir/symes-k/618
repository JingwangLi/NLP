Thanks so much for getting back to me on this! I actually found the deal 
number (after suffering a small heart attack) and the signed confirmation in 
Livelink. It ended up being an Avista error that circled back to us. It's 
cleared up with all involved parties now, but it was a little scary for a 
minute there. Anyway, no need to do anything more, but thanks again for your 
response - and I hope you feel better soon.
