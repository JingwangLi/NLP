Yes, Mike would like special language included in this deal's confirm letter. 
I spoke with him and a couple of the other traders, who said that they were 
aware of the change coming in April-02, but weren't aware they needed to 
enter comments in the deal. I'm sending an e-mail out to all of them to 
remind everyone to enter comments in deals that go past April-02 if they want 
special language.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,
Kate
