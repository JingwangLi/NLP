508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal 
Mirant checkout)

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
