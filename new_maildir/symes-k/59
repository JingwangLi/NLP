Rhonda did e-mail me about these deals last night. I forwarded it on to the 
Real Time manager and trader who entered the deals. It was actually a new 
real time guy using another trader's i.d. because he was waiting for his own 
- I don't think this is the kind of mistake the veterans should be making. At 
any rate, Bill changed the counterparty name and trader i.d. in all of these 
deals.

Thanks for the heads up on this.
