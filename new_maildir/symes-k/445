I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to 
have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to 
sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application 
already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal 
numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me 
know if that sounds good.
