Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Kate
