To re-cap:
I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal 
Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms 
group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They 
will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals 
will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if 
they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.
