I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

Thanks,
Kate
