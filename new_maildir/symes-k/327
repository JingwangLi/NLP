I spoke with Chris, and he called Alicia who said she still believes the deal 
should be for April, not May. Chris said they are in a dispute at this point, 
because he believes the term should be May. So he asked me to leave the deals 
alone for the moment, and he will be in touch later today. Would you like me 
to make a note of this in the comments sections of the deals?
