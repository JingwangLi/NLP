You're probably right, Sharen, since the counterparty continues to send 
confirmation letters with FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power 
& Light. Unfortunately, the marketer who contacts our trader to transact 
identifies himself as being with Florida Power & Light, which is where I 
believe the confusion is coming from. I'll let the traders know of the 
correct counterparty name, though. 

Thanks for the heads up,
Kate
