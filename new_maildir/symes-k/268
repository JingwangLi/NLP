Yes - I was also going to mention that I talked with Christian Yoder about 
this, and he confirmed that the counterparty name in the contract is The City 
of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Port of Oakland 
board, and on and on and on. So we'll be using that name, NOT the Port of 
Oakland, when doing deals with this counterparty. And out of curiosity, does 
anyone you know of trade with simply the Port of Oakland?

Thanks for following up,
Kate
