I spoke with Mark Fischer about this - Tom Alonso stepped out of the office 
for a minute - and he said Tom would probably want to talk to his contact 
with FPL. So I'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. I'll 
also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in 
just a minute.

Thanks,
Kate
