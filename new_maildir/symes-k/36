The deal has been fixed. I'm so sorry about that - when I changed the dates 
at the top, the computer asked if I'd like it to copy the changes into the 
strips. I should have checked to make sure it did this correctly! 

And I will definitely add notes in the comments section of deals I change 
from now on. Thanks for the tip.
