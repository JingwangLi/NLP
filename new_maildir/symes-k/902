Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate
