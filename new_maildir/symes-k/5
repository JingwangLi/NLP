No. It looks like these are all the deals Christian Yoder and our other 
lawyers are working on. Christian is writing up confirms for these, and 
actually has a few of them done. He said he'd be contacting Sharen Cason and 
faxing her copies of the finished letters very soon.

Please let me know if you need me to add comments to these deals to make it 
more clear. I'm going to talk further with Christian and Val Sabo on my end 
to better understand what the DEAL is with these deals, because they've been 
plaguing me all day.

I'll keep you posted on the progress of this, but in the meantime you don't 
have to send revised confirms.

Thanks,
Kate
