Mark -
I'm sending you two things that I hope will clarify some of these 
discrepancies. The first is an updated Real Time spreadsheet for 3/19 that 
shows the volumes for deal 553219. Bill Williams and I looked over their 
spreadsheets and could not find this deal in the 3/16 sheet - so I'm still 
wondering why EES thinks this deal should be in at a different date and 
price. 

The second document is a modified version of the sheet you sent me. In it, I 
answered the questions I could and changed things I knew were wrong. I also 
asked questions on deals where I can't find a discrepancy between my sheet 
and EnPower. 

Please keep in contact on this issue - I know this is only a start.
