I'm sorry - I haven't been keeping up with the Dow Jones data storage. I can 
put the data in the sheet - I just need to take a look at how you've set it 
up and determine what I should be entering where. I'm running to grab some 
lunch right now, but when I get back let's talk about how to compare the Dow 
Jones volumes with our daily volumes. I can either send you my data sheet 
each afternoon, or add a Dow Jones volume table to the sheet myself - however 
you'd like. We'll talk.
