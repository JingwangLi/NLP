These are all West Services deals, and our services traders - Les Rawson and 
Stan Cocke - prefer to confirm their own deals with counterparties. So these 
should not be confirmed. Kim Hundl and I have been working on long lists of 
deals that went in to be confirmed and we've since gone in and changed them. 
Services, Real Time, and EES trades are among those. If you'd like, you can 
talk to her about what we decided to confirm and not confirm, or you can give 
me a call at (503) 464-7486.

Thanks for checking!
Kate
