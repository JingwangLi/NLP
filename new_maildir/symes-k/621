The third deal - 531910 - I'm checking on with Les right now. Sharen Cason 
asked me this morning who the contact was, and typically with services deals 
the traders like to confirm the deals themselves - so I'm not sure if it 
should be confirmed.

The other two contain contact names - are they not valid in GCP? Do you need 
new names and phone numbers or just numbers to go along with those names?
