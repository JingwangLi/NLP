She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few 
weeks ago, and Holli told me she'd send it to the confirms group as soon as 
she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's 
going on. I guess she's getting a little fed up of beating around the bush 
with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them 
today. I'll let you know whatever we find out this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate
