Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at 
least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's 
the deal....

488121 - no fee
488122 - other side of spread - FEE

495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso

495206 - no fee
495207 - other side of spread - FEE

If they still dispute, let me know and I'll sick the traders on them. Sorry 
for the hassle.

Thanks,
Kate
