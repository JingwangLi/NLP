BLOOMBERG
585337 - changed to APS
I can't remember - did we decide to use APS as CTPY name with Bloomberg only 
until they change it to Pinnacle in their system? This won't mess up confirms 
later?

AMEREX
585230 - del. point is palo, says Driscoll - he's calling his broker to clear 
this up

Thanks,
Kate
