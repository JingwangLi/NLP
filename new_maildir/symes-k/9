I've just spoken with Christian Yoder, who said he's got the confirmation 
letters for these deals on his desk. He's also planning to call you to 
discuss this further - these deals and several others entered as part of an 
EES acquisition will all be confirmed differently than usual. I'm not 
completely clear on the subject, so I'm going to defer to Christian's legal 
expertise.

But if you have any other questions, please let me know. I can certainly sit 
down with Christian and maybe we can all conference call on the subject.

Thanks,
Kate
