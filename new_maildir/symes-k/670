Wow! That's so exciting to see the words "clean checkout" associated with OUR 
beloved brokers and traders. Thanks for your persistence with all of this - I 
know it gets frustrating. Please let me know whenever I can help - I'm trying 
to respond quickly to the e-mails coming from Houston confirms, but in the 
interest of accuracy I'm also trying to be thorough. So feel free to give me 
a nudge every once in awhile.

Thanks,
Kate
