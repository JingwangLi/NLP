I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

Thanks,
Kate
