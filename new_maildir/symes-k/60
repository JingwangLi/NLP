I've forwarded this to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who asked to be 
notified of problems and discrepancies with Short Term West Hourly deals. 
I'll change these deals in the system; meanwhile, Bill's going to talk to 
Geir about using the correct counterparty name. 

Thanks for catching that.
