These deals are all parts of sleeves we did for EES, and we only include a 
broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two 
deals; they're highlighted in red:

459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve)

457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee)

468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side)
468440 - no change (buy side)

And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any 
of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
