I've heard some mumbling about problems with EES deals, so this doesn't come 
as much of a surprise. Here's what I've done:

On the first deal, #481619, I'd feel more comfortable if Mike Swerzbin, the 
trader who did the deal, gave his okay to change the price. I've left a 
message with him to verify the price, and at the very latest I'll see him 
tomorrow morning.

Deal #480433 cannot be killed because it contains liquidated strips; however, 
it looks like Phil Platter, the Short Term California scheduler, has alreday 
zeroed out the deal. Will this work? Or is there another method by which I 
can go about killing a deal? (Sorry to ask so many questions, but 90% of our 
office is already gone for the holidays and quite difficult to get ahold of.)

I've changed #481620. I think the trader just overcompensated for the change 
back from Daylight Savings Time. I'll remind these guys to always enter PPT 
for the time zone, to be on the safe side.

I hope this solves at least some of the problems for now. I'll let you know 
as soon as I talk to Swerzbin tomorrow. Let me know if there's anything else.
