595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Thanks,
Kate
