Ellen,
 Is this what you are talking about.  If so, I prepared this amendment so 
that we could get out of a bad trading position.  The customer had the right 
to use first of the month pricing on volume swings.  I believe that Lee 
Papayoti did the deal.  Gary Chapman with Union Carbide indicated that the 
deal is done, however, we are waiting on signatures.
