No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got 
resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at 
Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil 
Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 
234-4204.
