Interesting.  I seem to remember that under Texas law, everything goes to the 
surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Greg and ex should 
have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I 
looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.  

In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If, 
God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make 
life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill 
doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will 
for cheap.
