I too enjoyed our talk last night ( I'm always interested in other 
viewpoints, it is only by examining them that we challenge our own).   

  The Happy Hour tonight is at Teala's on West Dallas.  My recommendation is 
that you plan on arriving at 7:00 or later.  Hopefully by that time my old 
manager will have had enough to drink he won't mind all these other people on 
his tab.

I must admit, the job just keeps sounding better and better.

P.S. Thanks for the compliment...that's a quality I like being associated 
with.
