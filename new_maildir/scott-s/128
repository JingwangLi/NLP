Christine, this looks fine to me.  Please circulate to the appropriate people 
for approval with a notation that Appendix or Exhibit whatever provides that 
the quantity goes to zero during Apr-Oct.  If you need to reach me, I'll be 
logged in from about 9 to 10 a.m. your time before I go to our hearing here 
in SF.  Sorry for the late response; it's been a little crazy out here!
