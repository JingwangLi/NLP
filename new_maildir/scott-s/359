Ted, here are a few suggested changes.
Also, regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 1 
(about notice of default, payment within 15 days, etc.), I do not think that 
language was objectionable from a legal standpoint, and might actually be 
helpful as far as giving them a payment deadline.  However, if it's 
inconsistent with your procedures, or you just don't like having to give them 
notice, I see no problem at all with crossing it out.
