Although, as a women, "cojones" aren't necessarily the best attribute to 
have...there never has been, nor will there ever be a question of my 
possessing them - even you would have to concede that much.  As for the bet, 
if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little 
bit of a "problem" gambling and I could not in good conscious have acted as 
an enabler.  And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good 
times and the bad and believe me I been there through it all (a degrading 
loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over 
Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got.  
Speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your 
conference...but I'm sure the Pac-10's record against non-conference 
opponents is really helping to ease that blow.  Speaking of feather's in the 
conference cap, looks like our next national champion is going to be from the 
Big 12 - will wonders never cease.

My Monday is going great, thank you very much and I will show extreme 
restraint and refrain from any Chips comments ( Besides, I don't have time to 
type that much ).  UCLA could stand a chance next year if the NFL doesn't 
prove too tempting to some of your vets...how does that saying go,  "Like 
rats fleeing a sinking ship?"
