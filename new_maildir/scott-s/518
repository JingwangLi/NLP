Wilson, I treasure your NY attitude.  I think part of the reason you find so 
few hotties in Houston/Texas is that travel and exposure add such an 
intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced 
either.

        I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more 
lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience.
