Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course 
need to be filled in for $$ amount and term.
Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?  I know we probably 
do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have 
two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.  It is 
not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to 
do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two 
agreements, let me know.
