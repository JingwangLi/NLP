Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would 
be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about 
what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of 
my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people.

If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my 
Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on 
Monday morning.

The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore 
muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so 
I do not end up with another weekend like the last.

I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, 
but I'll let you know.

Call if you get lonely! 

Love,
Sooz
