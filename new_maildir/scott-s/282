Marcelo,

Thanks for the update.  I have been given a green light as well to go ahead 
and start testing my traders deals.  Let me know if you just need TAGG deal 
numbers for testing purposes, or if I need to rebook deals myself in your 
test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel 
models.  

Thanks,
Susan
