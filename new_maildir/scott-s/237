Hey girl!  Thanks for the book and the CD.  I lazed around the house enjoying 
both yesterday morning.  After we played tennis, Bill took me to Berryhill 
for fish tacos (al fresco) and later that evening we went to yet another 
Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).  So it 
was a good birthday.  
Have a good day!
