Okay, I have to admit it is somewhat of a pansy schedule and it is going to 
be like that for about the next three years.  However, this season will give 
us the perfect opportunity to get all of our freshman and sophomores the 
necessary experience needed to win the National title two to three years from 
now.  Mack Brown is a master at pacing a teams rise to the top.  With the #1 
recruiting class in the country last year and a top 5 class this year the 
future looks bright for the Longhorns.  Besides, our stadium's on campus and 
we've sold over 40,000 season tickets...the games are bound to be fun 
regardless of how weak the opponents may be.
