Hey,

Very jealous about the Canary Island trip...that sounds wonderful.  Take my advice though...use sunscreen!  I was really good about applying everywhere except for my lower back and the back of my thighs and I've paid the price.  Kind of looks like I was scolded with boiling water.  

So I've got Lisa's wedding this weekend and my San Diego trip the next.  I'm taking Friday off this week so I can go to the Bridesmaid/House Party luncheon in San Antonio and we've got Good Friday off from work the next week so I'm looking at two four-day work weeks.  My how things have changed.

I think Katy and I are going to a corporate sponsors reception at the MFA tomorrow night and Lisa has expressed interest in going as well, but we'll see about that.  She's always enthusiastic in the beginning.  All in all things are pretty good.  

Talk to you soon,
Sue
