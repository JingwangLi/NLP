Trip was excellent.  I took pictures, but most of them where taken inside 
pubs so who knows how they'll turn out.  I definitely thought about you and 
how much you would love the area Emily's living in (very upscale, English and 
proper).  I also had an impromptu interview thanks to Dave Oliver so we'll 
see.  I will talk to you more later as I am in the thick of calcing and am 
suffering a bit of jet lag.
