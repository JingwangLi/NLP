Stewart,
	Let me make this very clear, no phone call will take place until you and I talk about this issue.

I am not interested in talking any more about this issue - you deal with it however you want and call whenever you want.  I am out of the process completely.  I will call you at noon tomorrow just to make sure it got resolved.
