Pamela,
	Where do you get the numbers for the EEMC tab? Here are the stages of the process that I currently know about:
	
		1) EES sends the schedule  file to the EPMI server
		2) Calf. schedulers pull EES schedules into their portfolio and submit the information to the ISO.
		3) ISO sends back Day Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES original schedule)
		4) ISO Sends back Hour Ahead Finals (Changes could occur with EES schedule from the Day Ahead Market)

	As you can see, there is quite a few places that changes can occur to an EES schedule in the course of a day. So I am trying to follow the information flow on both the EES side and the EPMI side. If the only schedule you see is the one that is originally sent to the  EPMI server, then I can see where we have the potential to have many unexplained variances. If this is the case, this may be nothing more than providing you with the incremental information that is provided by the ISO during the course of a given day. Just update me on your process flow, and I will keep this issue moving along until completion.

								Thanks
