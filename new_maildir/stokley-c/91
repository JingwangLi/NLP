Kristian,
	I will get the list of accomplishments out by end of business tommowrow. I apologize for taking so long to respond, it has been pretty hectic around here the last couple of weeks. I have been desperately trying to fill the positions within the group.  Hope all is going well with you and Monica. Did you find a place to live yet?


	ps     Did you hear that PG&E declared bankruptcy?
