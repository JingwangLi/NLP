Pamela,
	I understand that you are getting your information from the schedulers, my question is at what point in the process. Is this the info that is originally sent to the server with no updates? If so, then we are going to keep having variances until we get you more up to date information. I know that the Calf. schedulers send a new file to EES after the close of the Day Ahead Mrkt, yet I don't see these updated numbers reflected in the schedules that you sent me. Find out from your schedulers if this is the original schedule that is sent to us on the server, and if so, are they updating the file after the changes in the Day-Ahead Mrkt. I want to make sure that you and I are chasing true variances and not timing variances.
