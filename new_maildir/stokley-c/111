I will look into what timeline that we can get these guys paid on and talk with you today. As far as the other issue, we are no where close to being able to take that project on. The current new hires are just to get us caught up in the short term. After that, then it may be a do able item, but right now all I want the new guys concentrating on is getting us caught up. I see this hand-off taking place sometime in the 3rd qtr of this year, when we get the rest of our staff in place.
