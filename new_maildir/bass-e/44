we had a great time at the swan.  we went to eat with about 15 people from 
enron and made our way to the swan at around 11:30.  it sounds like you had a 
pretty laid back saturday, that's good to have occassionaly.  

I have you jacket in my car, so let me know what you want to do about that. 

talk to you later,
