Things are going well here.  I have been pretty busy losing lots of money at 
work.  
Brian and Hector are going to Europe at the end of the month, but I can't go 
because of work.  It doesn't bother me that much though.   I will probably 
try to take a trip over there in May.  On top of that I am thinking about a 
cruise this summer some time.
Brian and I are actually moving this weekend to a new apartment within the 
Park at Midtown.  Brian recently got his bike stolen from the balcony, so we 
are going to move to an interior apartment.  Of course, I wouldn't expect you 
to relate to any of this because you have never seen my apartment.  Oh well, 
I guess you have your priorities.  

Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  How are things with you and the 
fam?
