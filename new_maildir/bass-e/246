Gary,

We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to 
sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as 
possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the 
forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by 
the end of the week with an acceptable target.

Thanks,

Eric
