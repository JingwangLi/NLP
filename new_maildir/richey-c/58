i always urine the air

hey!  wow, now i'm really in debt - a *real* letter followed by an email!  I planned to 
write you back in vivo (rather than in silico), but you've shamed me into it.

i just talked to omar on sunday for awhile - haven't spoken to him in a long time and
it made me want to come to new york.  he was also pressuring me to come to the 
reunion, which i can't imagine doing, but are you going?  it would be fun to go back
- just a logistical pain in the ass.  

thanks for thinking of me.

it's turning into summer here now too, which is exciting, as much because the summer
is glorious as the winter is brutal.  i like canada alot.  very good people and i think i'm 
probably living in the least cool big city.  work is going well, but i don't enjoy the office
culture as much as portland, which is severly disappointing, considering that i spend
alot of time here.  still, it's not bad, just more normal/corporate.  

have you read any good books?  i sold my tv and now often find myself with the choice
of staring blankly at the wall or reading something.  more into page turners than great
works.  speaking of, i just read _kitchen confidential_, which deals with new york and also
served to make me want to visit.  you should be an actress for awhile and then write a book
about the wild and crazy life backstage.  

i heard you were in a play!  howz that?
