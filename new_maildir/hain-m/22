Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and 
outside counsel on it.  I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm 
pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of  Bracewell and Patterson for one 
project.  Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates 
under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  The Commission has 60 days to 
accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or 
the filing is deemed accepted.  EWG applications are made under Section 32 of 
the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act.  Thereunder, the Commission must make 
an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application.
