That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually 
changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily 
Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me 
know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow.

Thanks,
Robin
