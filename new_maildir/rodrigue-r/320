Sorry to hear you're being hazed today.  I'm glad to know he thinks you are 
worth something.  You can be pretty certain I won't be coming to join your 
new group when I rotate.  I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group 
so I don't have to do anything.

Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the 
fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited 
today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today 
off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift 
day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December 
calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the 
first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited.  

Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today?

Bye-bye.
