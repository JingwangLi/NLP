What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little 
stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend 
coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. 
afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range 
around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to 
rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies.  

As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the 
Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call 
Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I 
might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't 
know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do.  
Thanks for the help with this.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin
