Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are 
definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can 
stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up 
at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably 
try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and 
catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  

What'cha doing for lunch?
