Now that that lady is irritating you maybe you'll finally miss me.  Well, I 
might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer 
that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll 
be in Chicago by March 12th.  Yikes...I have a lot to do before then.  We 
need to all go to lunch before I leave.  

Good luck ignoring your neighbor.  RR
