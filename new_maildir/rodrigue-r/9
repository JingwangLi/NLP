About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime 
as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking 
about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now.  

And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for 
breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it 
home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some.  

I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that 
you blew him off.
