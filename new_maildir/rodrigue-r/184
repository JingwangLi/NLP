Great.  We're never going to get to eat are we?  I was actually thinking of 
taking a long lunch and then dropping you off back here and I'd disappear for 
another couple of hours.  However, Lavo just called and wanted Jeff in his 
office, so I'm not sure I'm going to get to leave at all.  I'll let you know 
when Jeff gets back.
