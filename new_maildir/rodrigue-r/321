What...A tax book not helpful?  Aren't you glad you didn't have to suffer 
through that class?  Everything went fine this morning.  I just had to 
rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!  Lavo seemed happy 
with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get 
much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to 
bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and 
look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other 
than that I'm okay.

And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?

Talk to ya later,
Robin
