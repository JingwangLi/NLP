Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind 
of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't 
submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though.  

How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your 
boss yesterday?

Later,
Robin
