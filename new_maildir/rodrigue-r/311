My morning was great...no problems, everything nice and quiet the way I like 
it.  But this afternoon has been a little hectic.  Oh, well, it's making time 
go much faster.  Well except for the meeting with disable...that dragged on 
and on.  I'm so excited about getting out of here at a decent time.  If 
people will quit asking me questions so I can finish changing formulas on the 
basis report I'm going to get out of here by 3...that's my goal anyway.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Ps Congrats on realizing that you're a really smart guy and that it's your 
boss causing your stress!
