What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on 
Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for 
overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I 
can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of 
shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit 
these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it 
felt like.  

Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with 
how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always 
asking and driving you crazy.  

Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.
