I need to look and see what I have.  But first, you are not going with some 
boys are you???

I have a really cheap sleeping bag, some collaspable water bottles, all sorts 
of small cooler type things, OHOHOH, I have a "wet seal" bag that you could 
put some goodies in to keep them dry.  

Do you need fishing stuff?
