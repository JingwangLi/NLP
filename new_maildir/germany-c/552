Why yes we do and here it is.  We create a new worksheet each month.  The 
worksheet you are looking for is "Rates".  Assume the rate you are looking at 
is FT unless specified otherwise.   And, depending on what you are looking 
at, we may not have GRI included in the surcharges.  The password to modify 
is the filename "2000tran08".
