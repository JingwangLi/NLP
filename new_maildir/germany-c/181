Let's see.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me 
know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out.


Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I 
welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract 
and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing 
scenarios."
