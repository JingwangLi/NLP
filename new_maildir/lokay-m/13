Hi Mike,

Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just 
got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave 
temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!

How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you 
love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be 
speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and 
financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much 
shorter!

Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?!
