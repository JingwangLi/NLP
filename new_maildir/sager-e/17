Hi Limor

The reason why we have not at this time proposed to include Affiliates of t=
he DP in setoff rights (i.e. changing the setoff from a triangular version =
to square) is due to enforceability concerns absent securing the written ag=
reement of all parties involved.  We are, however, on a cp by cp basis, sta=
rting to pursue master netting agreements which would tie all masters toget=
her and permit setoff on a square basis.  This undertaking requires a fairl=
y extensive due diligence review. =20

Hope this explanation helps.  Call if you want to discuss further.
