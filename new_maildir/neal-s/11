I talked with Chris Holmes last week and got very positive feedback about 
your interviews.  I told him about our working together in Argentina 
and your activities down there and gave him an overview of your skill set.  I 
have left a message with Mike Moore but he is out of town 
and he has not returned my call yet.    
I hope all is well with you.  I will call or email when I talk with the 
others.

Sincerely,

Scott
